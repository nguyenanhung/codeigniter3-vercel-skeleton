# CodeIgniter v3 Framework - Skeleton Vercel Application

This is the package `nguyenanhung/codeigniter3-skeleton`, customized, packaged, and configured to be suitable for
deployment on the Serverless Vercel application.

In this package, the main modifications are related to configuration to make it suitable for deployment. There isn't
much difference compared to the `codeigniter3-skeleton` package.

## Install

Run the following command to install the `nguyenanhung/codeigniter3-vercel-skeleton` application and deploy a new
project:

```shell
composer create-project nguyenanhung/codeigniter3-vercel-skeleton [my-app-name]
```

Replace `[my-app-name]` with the name of your new project directory, for example, `my-website`:

```shell
composer create-project nguyenanhung/codeigniter3-vercel-skeleton my-website
```

## Start Application on Docker

Quickly deploy the application with a pre-built Docker container:

Build the Docker container:

```

Start the application on Docker:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

```

```

Open Service in URL

```

## Deploying this package on Vercel with full compatibility

First, make sure you have the Vercel CLI installed. If you haven't already, you can install it using npm (Node.js
package manager):

```shell
npm install -g vercel
```

1. Navigate to your project directory containing the `nguyenanhung/codeigniter3-vercel-skeleton` application.
2. Now, you need to log in to your Vercel account if you haven't already. Run the following command and follow the
   prompts:

```shell
vercel login
```

Once logged in, you can deploy your project using the Vercel CLI. Run the following command:

```shell
vercel --prod
```

This command will deploy your project to Vercel with production settings. Vercel will provide you with a unique URL for
your deployed application.

Visit the provided URL in your web browser to access your deployed CodeIgniter v3 application on Vercel.

That's it! Your application should now be deployed on Vercel with full compatibility. If you encounter any issues or
need further assistance, feel free to ask.
